The purpose of the work is to understand, using genetics, the behavior of those people who tend not to answer the questions in a 
questionnaires when they have the opportunity to do so. 

The first step is to develop a missingness phenotype to characterize the non-responders and to identify shared characteristics of individuals 
driving this bias. In this context, non responders are those who prefer not to answer or chose the option “I don’t know” in a question 
when available. Afterwards, heritability has been estimated on the missingness phenotype defined for non-responders and genetic 
correlation has been calculated with other heritable phenotypes.
